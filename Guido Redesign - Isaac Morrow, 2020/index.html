                <h1>- A Brief Biography -</h1>
                <p>Guido van Rossum is the creator of the Python programming language. He grew up in the Netherlands and studied at the University of Amsterdam, where he graduated with a Master's Degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. His first job after college was as a programmer at CWI, where he worked on the ABC language, the Amoeba distributed operating system, and a variety of multimedia projects. During this time he created Python as side project. He then moved to the United States to take a job at a non-profit research lab in Virginia, married a Texan, worked for several other startups, and moved to California. In 2005 he joined Google, where he obtained the rank of Senior Staff Engineer, and in 2013 he started working for Dropbox as a Principal Engineer. In October 2019 he retired. Until 2018 he was Python's BDFL (Benevolent Dictator For Life), and he is still deeply involved in the Python community. Guido, his wife and their teenager live in Silicon Valley, where they love hiking, biking and birding.</p>

                    <p>I am retired, working on personal projects (and maybe a book).
                    I have worked for Dropbox, Google, Elemental Security, Zope
                    Corporation, BeOpen.com, CNRI, CWI, and SARA.  (See
                    my <a href="Resume.html">resume</a>.)  I created Python while at CWI.

                    <P>You can send an email to me at <a href="">nbpkv@nthps.jvt</a>.
                    I read everything sent there, but I receive too much email to respond
                    to everything. <i>In order to contact me, use Caesar Cypher 7! :)</i>
                    <br><br>
                    <H3>My Name</H3>
                    
                
                    <P>My name often poses difficulties for Americans.
                    
                    <P><b>Pronunciation:</b> in Dutch, the "G" in Guido is a hard G,
                    pronounced roughly like the "ch" in Scottish "loch".  (Listen to the
                    sound clip below!)  However, if you're
                    American, you may also pronounce it as the Italian "Guido".  I'm not
                    too worried about the associations with mob assassins that some people
                    have. :-)
                    
                    <P><b>Spelling:</b> my last name is two words, and I'd like to keep it
                    that way, the spelling on some of my credit cards notwithstanding.
                    Dutch spelling rules dictate that when used in combination with my
                    first name, "van" is not capitalized: "Guido van Rossum".  But when my
                    last name is used alone to refer to me, it is capitalized, for
                    example: "As usual, Van Rossum was right."
                    
                    <P><b>Alphabetization:</b> in America, I show up in the alphabet under
                    "V".  But in Europe, I show up under "R".  And some of my friends put
                    me under "G" in their address book...
